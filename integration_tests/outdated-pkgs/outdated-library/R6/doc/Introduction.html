<p>The R6 package provides a type of class which is similar to R’s standard reference classes, but it is more efficient and doesn’t depend on S4 classes and the methods package.</p>
<div id="r6-classes" class="section level2">
<h2>R6 classes</h2>
<p>R6 classes are similar to R’s standard reference classes, but are lighter weight, and avoid some issues that come along with using S4 classes (R’s reference classes are based on S4). For more information about speed and memory footprint, see the Performance vignette.</p>
<p>Unlike many objects in R, instances (objects) of R6 classes have reference semantics. R6 classes also support:</p>
<ul>
<li>public and private methods</li>
<li>active bindings</li>
<li>inheritance (superclasses) which works across packages</li>
</ul>
<p>Why the name R6? When R’s reference classes were introduced, some users, following the names of R’s existing class systems S3 and S4, called the new class system R5 in jest. Although reference classes are not actually called R5, the name of this package and its classes takes inspiration from that name.</p>
<p>The name R5 was also a code-name used for a different object system started by Simon Urbanek, meant to solve some issues with S4 relating to syntax and performance. However, the R5 branch was shelved after a little development, and it was never released.</p>
<div id="basics" class="section level3">
<h3>Basics</h3>
<p>Here’s how to create a simple R6 class. The <code>public</code> argument is a list of items, which can be functions and fields (non-functions). Functions will be used as methods.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(R6)

Person &lt;- R6Class(&quot;Person&quot;,
  public = list(
    name = NA,
    hair = NA,
    initialize = function(name, hair) {
      if (!missing(name)) self$name &lt;- name
      if (!missing(hair)) self$hair &lt;- hair
      self$greet()
    },
    set_hair = function(val) {
      self$hair &lt;- val
    },
    greet = function() {
      cat(paste0(&quot;Hello, my name is &quot;, self$name, &quot;.\n&quot;))
    }
  )
)</code></pre>
<p>To instantiate an object of this class, use <code>$new()</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ann &lt;- Person$new(&quot;Ann&quot;, &quot;black&quot;)
#&gt; Hello, my name is Ann.
ann
#&gt; &lt;Person&gt;
#&gt;   Public:
#&gt;     greet: function
#&gt;     hair: black
#&gt;     initialize: function
#&gt;     name: Ann
#&gt;     set_hair: function</code></pre>
<p>The <code>$new()</code> method creates the object and calls the <code>initialize()</code> method, if it exists.</p>
<p>Inside methods of the class, <code>self</code> refers to the object. Public members of the object (all you’ve seen so far) are accessed with <code>self$x</code>, and assignment is done with <code>self$x &lt;- y</code>. Note that by default, <code>self</code> is required to access members, although for non-portable classes which we’ll see later, it is optional.</p>
<p>Once the object is instantiated, you can access values and methods with <code>$</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ann$hair
#&gt; [1] &quot;black&quot;
ann$greet()
#&gt; Hello, my name is Ann.
ann$set_hair(&quot;red&quot;)
ann$hair
#&gt; [1] &quot;red&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Implementation note: The R6 object is basically an environment with the public members in it. The <code>self</code> object is bound in that environment, and is simply a reference back to that environment.</p>
</div>
<div id="private-members" class="section level3">
<h3>Private members</h3>
<p>In the previous example, all the members were public. It’s also possible to add private members:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Queue &lt;- R6Class(&quot;Queue&quot;,
  public = list(
    initialize = function(...) {
      for (item in list(...)) {
        self$add(item)
      }
    },
    add = function(x) {
      private$queue &lt;- c(private$queue, list(x))
      invisible(self)
    },
    remove = function() {
      if (private$length() == 0) return(NULL)
      # Can use private$queue for explicit access
      head &lt;- private$queue[[1]]
      private$queue &lt;- private$queue[-1]
      head
    }
  ),
  private = list(
    queue = list(),
    length = function() base::length(private$queue)
  )
)

q &lt;- Queue$new(5, 6, &quot;foo&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Whereas public members are accessed with <code>self</code>, like <code>self$add()</code>, private members are accessed with <code>private</code>, like <code>private$queue</code>.</p>
<p>The public members can be accessed as usual:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Add and remove items
q$add(&quot;something&quot;)
q$add(&quot;another thing&quot;)
q$add(17)
q$remove()
#&gt; [1] 5
q$remove()
#&gt; [1] 6</code></pre>
<p>However, private members can’t be accessed directly:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>q$queue
#&gt; NULL
q$length()
#&gt; Error: attempt to apply non-function</code></pre>
<p>Unless there is a compelling reason otherwise, methods should return <code>self</code> (invisibly) because it makes them chainable. For example, the <code>add()</code> method returns <code>self</code> so you can chain them together:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>q$add(10)$add(11)$add(12)</code></pre>
<p>On the other hand, <code>remove()</code> returns the value removed, so it’s not chainable:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>q$remove()
#&gt; [1] &quot;foo&quot;
q$remove()
#&gt; [1] &quot;something&quot;
q$remove()
#&gt; [1] &quot;another thing&quot;
q$remove()
#&gt; [1] 17</code></pre>
<p>Implementation note: When private members are used, the public environment is a child of the private environment, and the <code>private</code> object points to the private environment. Although public and private methods are bound (that is, they can be found) in their respective environments, the <em>enclosing</em> environment for all of those methods is the public environment. This means that private methods “run in” the public environment, so they will find public objects without needing an explicit <code>self$xx</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="active-bindings" class="section level3">
<h3>Active bindings</h3>
<p>Active bindings look like fields, but each time they are accessed, they call a function. They are always publicly visible.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Numbers &lt;- R6Class(&quot;Numbers&quot;,
  public = list(
    x = 100
  ),
  active = list(
    x2 = function(value) {
      if (missing(value)) return(self$x * 2)
      else self$x &lt;- value/2
    },
    rand = function() rnorm(1)
  )
)

n &lt;- Numbers$new()
n$x
#&gt; [1] 100</code></pre>
<p>When an active binding is accessed as if reading a value, it calls the function with <code>value</code> as a missing argument:</p>

<h3>Inheritance</h3>
<p>One R6 class can inherit from another. In other words, you can have super- and sub-classes.</p>
<p>Subclasses can have additional methods, and they can also have methods that override the superclass methods. In this example of a queue that retains its history, we’ll add a <code>show()</code> method and override the <code>remove()</code> method:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Note that this isn't very efficient - it's just for illustrating inheritance.
HistoryQueue &lt;- R6Class(&quot;HistoryQueue&quot;,
  inherit = Queue,
  public = list(
    show = function() {
      cat(&quot;Next item is at index&quot;, private$head_idx + 1, &quot;\n&quot;)
      for (i in seq_along(private$queue)) {
        cat(i, &quot;: &quot;, private$queue[[i]], &quot;\n&quot;, sep = &quot;&quot;)
      }
    },
    remove = function() {
      if (private$length() - private$head_idx == 0) return(NULL)
      private$head_idx &lt;&lt;- private$head_idx + 1
      private$queue[[private$head_idx]]
    }
  ),
  private = list(
    head_idx = 0

#&gt; Next item is at index 2

hq$remove()
#&gt; [1] 6</code></pre>
<p>Superclass methods can be called with <code>super$xx()</code>. The <code>CountingQueue</code> (example below) keeps a count of the total number of objects that have ever been added to the queue. It does this by overriding the <code>add()</code> method – it increments a counter and then calls the superclass’s <code>add()</code> method, with <code>super$add(x)</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>CountingQueue &lt;- R6Class(&quot;CountingQueue&quot;,
  inherit = Queue,
  public = list(
    add = function(x) {
      private$total &lt;&lt;- private$total + 1
      super$add(x)
    },
    get_total = function() private$total
  ),

    total = 0

<div id="fields-containing-reference-objects" class="section level3">
<h3>Fields containing reference objects</h3>
<p>If your R6 class contains any fields that also have reference semantics (e.g., other R6 objects, and environments), those fields should be populated in the <code>initialize</code> method. If the field set to the reference object directly in the class definition, that object will be shared across all instances of the R6 objects. Here’s an example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>SimpleClass &lt;- R6Class(&quot;SimpleClass&quot;,
  public = list(x = NULL)
)

SharedField &lt;- R6Class(&quot;SharedField&quot;,
  public = list(
    e = SimpleClass$new()
  )
)

s1 &lt;- SharedField$new()
s1$e$x &lt;- 1

s2 &lt;- SharedField$new()
s2$e$x &lt;- 2

# Changing s2$e$x has changed the value of s1$e$x
s1$e$x
#&gt; [1] 2</code></pre>
<p>To avoid this, populate the field in the <code>initialize</code> method:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>NonSharedField &lt;- R6Class(&quot;NonSharedField&quot;,
  public = list(
    e = NULL,
    initialize = function() e &lt;&lt;- SimpleClass$new()
  )
)

n1 &lt;- NonSharedField$new()
n1$e$x &lt;- 1

n2 &lt;- NonSharedField$new()
n2$e$x &lt;- 2

<div id="portable-and-non-portable-classes" class="section level2">
<h2>Portable and non-portable classes</h2>
<p>In R6 version 1.0.1, the default was to create <strong>non-portable</strong> classes. In subsequent versions, the default is to create <strong>portable</strong> classes. The two most noticeable differences are that portable classes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support inheritance across different packages. Non-portable classes do not do this very well.</li>
<li>Always require the use of <code>self</code> and <code>private</code> to access members, as in <code>self$x</code> and <code>private$y</code>. Non-portable classes can access these members with just <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, and do assignment to these members with the <code>&lt;&lt;-</code> operator.</li>
</ul>
<p>The implementation of the first point is such that it makes the second point necessary.</p>
<div id="using-self-and--" class="section level3">
<h3>Using <code>self</code> and <code>&lt;&lt;-</code></h3>
<p>With reference classes, you can access the field without <code>self</code>, and assign to fields using <code>&lt;&lt;-</code>. For example:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>RC &lt;- setRefClass(&quot;RC&quot;,
  fields = list(x = 'ANY'),
  methods = list(
    getx = function() x,
    setx = function(value) x &lt;&lt;- value
  )
)

rc &lt;- RC$new()
rc$setx(10)
rc$getx()
#&gt; [1] 10</code></pre>
<p>The same is true for non-portable R6 classes:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>NP &lt;- R6Class(&quot;NP&quot;,
  portable = FALSE,
  public = list(
    x = NA,
    getx = function() x,
    setx = function(value) x &lt;&lt;- value
  )
)

np &lt;- NP$new()
np$setx(10)
np$getx()
#&gt; [1] 10</code></pre>
<p>But for portable R6 classes (this is the default), you must use <code>self</code> and/or <code>private</code>, and <code>&lt;&lt;-</code> assignment doesn’t work – unless you use <code>self</code>, of course:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>P &lt;- R6Class(&quot;P&quot;,
  portable = TRUE,  # This is default
  public = list(
    x = NA,
    getx = function() self$x,
    setx = function(value) self$x &lt;- value
  )
)

p &lt;- P$new()
p$setx(10)
p$getx()

<h3>Adding members to an existing class</h3>
<p>It is sometimes useful to add members to a class after the class has already been created. This can be done using the <code>$set()</code> method on the generator object.</p>
